# SpaceBird 0

This is where SpaceBird 0 lives. We are currently developing the rocket engine and we have made a few designs along with some code.


## Creators

The SpaceBird 0 was created by Ayushman Kalita. I (Aadiraj Anil) came in when Ayushman was designing the first few prototypes. We do everything together as a team.

### Roadmap

- 22/05/2022, we made the CD (Converging-Diverging) nozzle that will compress the exhuast gases before expansion
Here is one picture!

- 23/05/2022, we have made a circuit diagram on Fritzing and are building the test circuit that will use water in place of the fuel, the circuit is a little messy but you can take a look (The brown coil is our igniter).
